The .ORG sale has raised a lot of questions about its acquisition and ICANN's behavior.
ICANN discharged its obligation to protect values it was created for and decided to silence the problem.
The board members have forget about the society it represents and ignore [serious conflict of interests](https://twitter.com/rumkin/status/1203857864168820736).
What means it's time for changes.

This is what should be done to fix the situation and restore the trust:

1. Domains like .com, .org, .net, etc should be decided as having special social role.
2. The process of voting for all changes related to global domains should be made more transparent and observable.
3. The number of voters should be significantly increased.
4. The voting progress should be publishing in realtime.
5. Infrastructure and the code of the global DNS should be open sourced.
6. Global domains prices should change according to the global economics analysis.
7. Several registrars should be able to manage the same top-level domain to provide competitive conditions.
8. Global DNS registration system should be upgraded to use the latest technological and development solutions: distributed registries, crypto signatures and public code review.
7. Current board members and people involved in .ORG acquisition should resign.
