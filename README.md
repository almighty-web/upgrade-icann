# Upgrade ICANN

According to the situation around the .ORG acquisition, we are, the users of the Internet, demanding ICANN to meet its obligations
and intervene into the deal, apply the changes in its own structure and processes to protect interests of
the people it presents according to [Bylaws](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/governance/bylaws-en).

## Conditions

Things that should be done:

1. The process of voting for all changes related to global domains should be made more transparent and observable.
2. The number of voters should be significantly increased at least 4 times.
3. Voting results should be published in realtime.
4. Infrastructure and the code of the global DNS should be open sourced.
5. Global domains prices should change according to the global economics analysis and should be based on fundamental economics measure like GDP, average wage or other suitable and update once a quarter.
6. Several registrars should be able to manage the same top-level domain to provide competitive conditions.
7. Global DNS should be upgraded to use the latest technological solutions: distributed registries, crypto signatures and public code review.
8. Current board members and people involved in .ORG acquisition should resign.

Sincerely yours, users of the Internet.
